GENERAL NOTES :
	- Be mindful of patenting (for example SIFT)
	- Compile OpenCV 3 for Python 3 including opencv_contrib http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/16/where-did-sift-and-surf-go-in-opencv-3/

2016 :

	November :

		22nd :
			- Started tutorials on pythonprogramming.net
			- Did draw.py, region.py, video.py and watch.py

	December :

		13th :
			- Managed to get back to work. Starting over on https://pythonprogramming.net/image-arithmetics-logic-python-opencv-tutorial/
			- Did add.py, book.py, filter.py, edge.py, recognition.py, extraction.py

		15th :
			- Did edgeDetection.py, featureMatch.py, bgReduce.py, objDetect.py
			- Reference for understanding SIFT in OpenCV : http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html

	January :

		4th :
			- Understood descriptors
			- Reinstalled Python and OpenCV following problems with unavailable functions http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/07/20/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-3-4-on-ubuntu/
			- Tested Sift and Surf on pictures, result not exactly the same as the example but still correct
			- Sift uses difference of Gaussians (DoG) to isolate the frequency range that is the most present in the picture
			- Did stitch_test.py and stitcher_test.py
			- Excellent result !
